In a moment, I'm going to ask you some questions about THREAT ASSESSMENT. These will require you to assess the risks inherent in certain scenarios, and evaluate possible responses. Answer honestly. If you are a human, you have nothing to fear.
Interference Task Key: B -> A -> O -> D -> E -> F

Suspect Must: Explain the dangers inherent in a long-term threat
 - Tom's marriage is slowly falling apart. What does he stand to lose?
 - What makes global warming dangerous?

Suspect Must: Evaluate a minor threat
 - You're late for work; the dors to the train are closing and the next train is not for ten minutes. What do you stand to lose if you miss this train?
 - You're travelling in another country; a police officer pulls you over, and explains that there will be no citation, but there is a $5 "convenience" charge. What do you risk by giving in?

Suspect Must: Evaluate an immediate threat
 - You smell smoke, and a baby is crying in the next room. What's at risk here?
 - You are being mugged. The robber is pointing a gun at your head. Describe at least three possible negative outcomes

Suspect Must: (While fulfilling another prompt) Evaluate the additional risks created by a response to a threat
 - what response offers the best possible outcomes here? What are the risks of that response?
 - What is the most violent way to resolve this situation? What new risks would that create?

Suspect Must: (While fulfilling another prompt) Propose an ineffective response to a threat already described
 - How might someone try to fix that, only to end up making things worse?
 - What's a response that would solve your immediate problem here, but cause worse problems long-term?

Suspect Must: (While fulfilling another prompt) Propose a quality that would be useful in responding to a threat already described
 - What physical attributes would make it easier to resolve that threat?
 - What sort of educational background would help in defusing that crisis?
