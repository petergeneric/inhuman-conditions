In a moment, I'm going to ask you some questions about CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING. These will require you to solve various hypothetical problems, then modify your solutions based on certain constraints. Answer honestly. If you are a human, you have nothing to fear.
Interference Task Key: A -> F -> E -> D -> C -> B

Suspect Must: Describe how they would overcome an unusual obstacle.
 - You are in a kitchen, holding a small child. A dish towel catches fire, how do you put it out?
 - You are in a landslide. How do you survive?
 
Suspect Must: Attempt to solve an apparently unsolvable problem.
 - You wake up in a featureless room with no exits. How do you escape?
 - I'm going to tell the department you're a robot, and there's nothing you can do about it. What now?
 
Suspect Must: Come up with a problem that would be solved by a given solution.
 - What sort of problem might be solved by building a bomb?
 - What sort of problem might be solved by hiding under a table?
 
Suspect Must: (While fulfilling another prompt) Explain how they would prepare for or prevent a given problem.
 - If you were designing this scenario, what could you add to make it easier?
 - How would you prepare for this if it were a real possibility?
 
Suspect Must: (While fulfilling another prompt) Solve a problem again with an additional obstacle.
 - Could you improvise a solution using only a screwdriver?
 - What if you had to do it without hands?
 
Suspect Must: (While fulfilling another prompt) Explain their thought process in arriving at a solution.
 - How did you arrive at that solution?
 - What's a solution you thought of, but rejected, along the way?
